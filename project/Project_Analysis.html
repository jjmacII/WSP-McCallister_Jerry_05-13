		<h1>Customer Information</h1>
		<ul class="Info">
			<li>
				Big State Pharmacy
			</li>
			<li>
				Project: Re-Design

		<h2>Site Intent:</h2>
		<p>
			The purpose of this project is to do a redesign of Big State Pharmacy's website. My goals for this project will be to
			restructure the site with proper validating html and css. Currently the site is showing errors in both html and css
			and improper use of code. Correcting these errors should result in a better performing page and faster loading and reduce the
			barrier for being found in search engines. The pharmacy is also a grill featuring many different items and has even been
			featured in a magazine. I would like to add more of an awareness to the grill on the site like adding the word grill in
			the site name and a more robust and full featured menu page instead of just plain text.
		</p>

		<p>
			Currently the page lacks any visual estithics making it very plain and not attractable to look at. For example the
			colors don't mix well together as well as the menu page is very long and just plain text. I would also like to incorperate
			the ability of refilling customers perscriptions online making it even easier, faster, and more efficient for the customer to obtain
			their perscriptions. I think the new site will be more inviting and easier to understand just what they offer at this establishment.
		</p>

		<h3>Targeted Audience:</h3>

		<p>
			The target audience of this site is people of all ages mainly between 40-70 who are looking for that hometown feel of a local pharmacy.
			This site will also generate interest from men and woman looking for a great meal. An example of a user visiting the site with demographic
			information is below.
